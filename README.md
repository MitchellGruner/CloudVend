# CloudVend
A full-stack web application that allows authenticated users to create profiles and post descriptive items.

This code is partly based on Colt Steele's "The Web Developer's Bootcamp 2020".  In this Udemy course, Colt taught RESTful techniques and deployed a fully functioning website for
campers to leave reviewes on campgrounds.  I loosely used his coding ideas in my own project.

This project was implemented with Node.js, MongoDB, JavaScript, HTML and CSS, Express, and Passport.js.
