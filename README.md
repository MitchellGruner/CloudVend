## CloudVend

A full-stack web application that allows authenticated users to create profiles, post descriptive items, and post comments on items.  Authenticated users can also delete their own items and comments, but can never erase other peopleâ€™s data.  MongoDB, Node.js, and Express.js was used throughout, as well as Passport.js for user authentication.  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was used for the front-end.

This code is partly based on Colt Steele's "The Web Developer's Bootcamp 2020".  In this Udemy course, Colt taught RESTful techniques and deployed a fully functioning website for
campers to leave reviewes on campgrounds.  I loosely used his coding ideas in my own project.

This project was implemented with Node.js, Mongoose, MongoDB, Express.js, JavaScript, HTML and CSS, and Passport.js.

## How It's Made

### Tech used: Mongoose, Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Lessons Learned:

I learned so much with this project, such as adding a database filled with user's data (such as their profile, items listed, and comments created), configuring this database with the front-end side of the full-stack web application, and adding user authentication. This project brought together my front-end development skills with various back-end languages, such as Mongoose, Express.js, and Node.js.
